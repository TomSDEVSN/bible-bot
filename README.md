# BibleBot

[Add bot to your discord](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=743786590371053651&scope=bot&permissions=3072)

## Description
This is a Discord bot that posts a random quote from the bible when you write `!bible` in the chat. Please note, that the quotes are from the German translation!

## Setup
To run the bot you have to put your bot token and the API key for the bible API (https://scripture.api.bible/) into your environment. You can either set it as environment variable or put it into an `.env` file (you can simply copy `.env.example`).

## Todos / Ideas
- [ ] Make it possible to search for a specific term
- [ ] Use some caching to improve performance
- [*] Text-To-Speech (TTS) either in chat or via voice channel
